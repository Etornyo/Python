As of my last update in September 2021, there are several computer vision algorithms and techniques available in various libraries and frameworks. Here are some of the most commonly used ones:

1. Object Detection: Algorithms designed to locate and classify objects within an image or video. Popular algorithms include Faster R-CNN, YOLO (You Only Look Once), SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector), and RetinaNet.

2. Image Segmentation: Techniques that partition an image into semantically meaningful regions. Examples include U-Net, Mask R-CNN, and SegNet.

3. Optical Flow: Methods for estimating the motion of objects between consecutive frames in a video. Lucas-Kanade and Farneback are some traditional algorithms used for this purpose.

4. Feature Detection and Description: Algorithms that detect and describe distinctive points or regions in an image, such as SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) and ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF).

5. Face Detection and Recognition: Techniques to detect and recognize human faces in images or videos. Popular methods include Haar Cascades, Viola-Jones, and deep learning-based approaches like FaceNet and OpenFace.

6. Image Classification: Algorithms for categorizing images into predefined classes or categories. Deep learning models like CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) have shown remarkable performance in this area.

7. Image Super-Resolution: Techniques to upscale low-resolution images to higher resolutions. Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Networks (SRCNN) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are commonly used for this task.

8. Image Style Transfer: Methods that apply the style of one image to another image while preserving its content. Neural style transfer is a popular approach for this purpose.

9. Image Denoising: Algorithms used to reduce noise in images, such as Non-local Means Denoising, BM3D, and Deep Image Prior.

10. Image Registration: Techniques to align images from different viewpoints or time instances. These algorithms are used in various applications, such as medical imaging and remote sensing.

These are just a few examples, and the field of computer vision is continually evolving, with new algorithms and techniques being developed regularly. Many of these algorithms are available in popular Python libraries like OpenCV, scikit-image, and deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

Always refer to the official documentation of the libraries and frameworks you use to understand the full range of available algorithms and their implementations. Additionally, since my knowledge is based on information available up to September 2021, there may have been further advancements in computer vision since then.
